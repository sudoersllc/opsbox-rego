# Testing Plugins and Handlers in OpsBox Using Pytest

This document provides an overview of how to test plugins, handlers, and the plugin registry in OpsBox using `pytest`. It includes details about the test directory structure, running tests, generating coverage reports, and writing new tests.

## Directory Structure

The testing framework is organized into different categories focusing on configuration, handlers, and registry management:

```bash
test/
├── config/
│   ├── rego_handler/              # Placeholder for rego-specific handler tests
│   ├── conftest.py                # Shared test configurations and fixtures
│   ├── test_file_finding.py       # Tests for finding plugin configuration files
│   ├── test_loading.py            # Tests for loading plugins and configs
│   └── test_property_access.py    # Tests for accessing plugin properties post-loading
├── general_handler/
│   └── test_hooks.py              # Tests for general plugin handler hooks
├── registry/
│   └── test_registry.py           # Tests for the plugin registry (loading, activating)
└── test_plugins.py                # Tests for overall plugin functionality
```

### Key Areas Covered

- **Config Tests (`config/`)**: Focus on configuration file loading, plugin file management, and property access.
- **General Handler Tests (`general_handler/`)**: Validate hook implementations and their interactions in the general plugin handler.
- **Registry Tests (`registry/`)**: Ensure the plugin registry manages loading, activating, and handling plugins correctly.
- **Plugin Functionality Tests (`test_plugins.py`)**: Validate that plugins work as expected when integrated into the system.

## Running Tests

### Running All Tests

To run all tests in the OpsBox project:

```bash
pytest
```

### Running Specific Tests

To run a specific test file, for example, registry tests:

```bash
pytest test/registry/test_registry.py
```

To run a specific test function in a file:

```bash
pytest test/general_handler/test_hooks.py::test_some_function
```

### Common Pytest Options

- **Verbose Output**:  
   ```bash
   pytest -v
   ```
  
- **Stop on First Failure**:  
   ```bash
   pytest -x
   ```

For more information on running tests and pytest options, see the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/usage.html).

## Generating Coverage Reports

To generate a coverage report for the tests, install the `pytest-cov` plugin if it's not already installed:

```bash
uv add pytest-cov
```

Then, run the tests with coverage enabled:

```bash
pytest --cov=<source_directory> --cov-report=html
```

This generates an HTML coverage report in the `htmlcov` directory. You can then view the report to see how much of your code is covered by tests.

Example for OpsBox:

```bash
pytest --cov=opsbox --cov-report=html
```

For more details, see the [pytest-cov documentation](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can run, extend, and create new tests for your OpsBox project using `pytest`. This ensures that all plugins, handlers, and registries are functioning as expected across different scenarios.
